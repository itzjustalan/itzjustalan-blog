Welcome random people on the internet!<br>
I post stuff about technology, terminal and other things here. This website is generated using vimwiki and is best consumed on a terminal browser (eg: lynx).<br>

I see tech as a tool and needless to say I'm always looking forward for better and effective ways to use them. I hate boring repetetive tasks and try to automate wherever I can. I'll try to post about all these as much as I can and meanwhile you can checkout my rss feed. Also feel free to mail me about your cool automation ideas and vim tips lol.
